# 2 Create a palindrome checker Tutorial

## Prerequisites

*   Understanding of string data structures.
*   Basic knowledge of loops (e.g., for loop) or recursion.
*   Familiarity with string manipulation concepts (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing non-alphanumeric characters).

## Approach

### Approach 1: Using string reversal

This approach involves reversing the input string and comparing it to the original string.

### Procedure

1. Preprocess the input string:
    *   Remove any non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).
    *   Convert the string to lowercase.
2. Reverse the processed string using one of the methods described in the "Reverse a String" tutorial.
3. Compare the processed string to its reversed version.
4. If they are the same, the original string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

### Approach 2: Using two pointers

This approach uses two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the string, and compares characters while moving the pointers towards the center.

### Procedure

1. Preprocess the input string as in Approach 1.
2. Initialize a left pointer to 0 and a right pointer to the last index of the processed string.
3. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
    *   Compare the characters at the left and right pointers.
    *   If they are different, the string is not a palindrome.
    *   Increment the left pointer.
    *   Decrement the right pointer.
4. If the loop finishes without finding any mismatches, the string is a palindrome.

### Approach 3: Using recursion

This approach involves using a recursive function to check if the string is a palindrome.

### Procedure

1. Preprocess the input string as in Approach 1.
2. Define a recursive function that takes the processed string, a start index, and an end index as arguments.
3. Base case: If the start index is greater than or equal to the end index, return true (the string is a palindrome).
4. Recursive step:
    *   If the characters at the start and end indices are different, return false (the string is not a palindrome).
    *   Otherwise, return the result of calling the recursive function with the start index incremented and the end index decremented.

### Approach 4: Using a stack

This approach involves using a stack to check if the string is a palindrome.

### Procedure

1. Preprocess the input string as in Approach 1.
2. Push the first half of the characters onto a stack.
3. If the string has an odd number of characters, skip the middle character.
4. For the remaining half of the characters:
    *   Pop a character from the stack.
    *   Compare it to the current character in the string.
    *   If they are different, the string is not a palindrome.
5. If the loop finishes without finding any mismatches, the string is a palindrome.

### Approach 5: Using built-in functions (if available)

Some programming languages provide built-in functions for checking palindromes. This approach utilizes those functions directly.

### Procedure

1. Preprocess the input string as in Approach 1.
2. Use the built-in palindrome checking function provided by the programming language.
3. Return the result.
